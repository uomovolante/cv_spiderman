  Financial planning
STEP 1
Create, in this order:
•	Proforma P&L
•	Proforma Cash Flow Statement
•	Proforma Balance Sheet
P&L
•	(E) is the first year, (F) are the forecasted years
•	First line is always revenue, then subtract operational costs (excluding depreciation) and calculate EBITDA. Then subtract depreciation and amortization (usually he just puts depreciation) to get to EBIT. Keep on as follows:
•	Remember that Interest (financial costs) are calculated on the previous year closing balance of IBS (or long term debt)
 
 
CF Statement
•	Use the indirect method → start from net income
 
OPERATING CF
•	Depreciation is added back because it’s not a cash expense
•	Working capital investment is the change in working capital between this year and the previous. If there an increase subtract it. If there is a decrease, add it.
•	Financial costs are added to get a clean operating cf (and subtracted back in the end to obtain the correct financing cf)
INVESTING CF
•	CAPEX (= Capital expenditures, investment in new fixed assets) are subtracted and used to obtain investing cf
FINANCING CF
•	Changes in IBD (Interest bearing debt) is the change in debt for which the company pays interest between this year and the previous. If there is an increase in debt (net new loans), add this increase. If there is a decrease in debt (net repayment), subtract it
•	New equity/dividends → add new equity, subtract dividend paid → if he asks to obtain a specific level of cash, you might increase new equity (which means issuing new stock)
•	Financial costs are subtracted (remember you added them before to get to a clean OPERATING CF)
CHANGE IN CASH
•	Sum operating, investing and financing cfs
Opening balance of cash
•	Cash from previous year
Closing balance of cash
•	Sum between opening balance of cash and change of cash

To get the investment in NWC, you need to calculate the NWC
NWC = Current assets – Current Liabilities = AR + Inventory – AP – Accruals and provisions
Remember not to include cash!!!
 
 
BS
•	For the BS, start by copying the assets, liabilities and equity provided for the first year
•	Then modify the values for the following year, according to the changes that occurred during the year (e.g. new investments in fixed assets, inventory, ar, ap, debt,…)
 
•	In some cases he just gives you equity instead of common stock, capital surplus/acc. Retained earnings and previous year net income
Next year
•	Fixed assets is the sum of previous year fixed asset + new investment in fixed assets (capex) – depreciation
•	Cash is taken from the CF statement closing cash balance for that year
•	Common stock is the sum of previous year common stock + new equity – dividends
•	Capital surplus/acc. Retained earnings (if he added it, otherwise it’s included in equity) is the sum of previous year capital surplus/acc. Ret. Earnings + net income of the previous year
•	Net income (always if he put the item) is the net income from p&l. If he didn’t put the item, just add it to common stock/equity
•	Long-term debt is the sum of previous year long-term debt and new debt – repayments (usually though he just gives you an IBD table that show how it changes over time)
 
STEP 2
Estimation of FCFE and FCFF
FCFE (indirect method)
1.	Copy the P&L statement
2.	Add a section containing the following:
a.	+ depreciation & amortization
b.	– investment in fixed assets (CAPEX)
c.	– working capital investment (→ WC increased from previous year) or + if it decreases
d.	+ change in IBD (if debt increased, it will increase the FCFE)
= FCFE
FCFE (direct method)
1.	– New equity
2.	+ Dividends
3.	+ Change in cash
= FCFE

FCFF (indirect method)
1.	Copy the P&L statement until EBIT
2.	Calculate Tax on EBIT and subtract it to get NOPAT
3.	Add a section containing the following:
a.	+ depreciation & amortization
b.	– investment in fixed assets (CAPEX)
c.	– working capital investment (→ WC increased from previous year) or + if it decreases
= FCFF
FCFF (direct method)
1.	– New equity
2.	+ Dividends
3.	+ Change in cash
4.	Change in IBD
o	– New IBD
o	+ Repayment of IBD
5.	+ After tax interest [→ financial costs * (1-tax rate)]
= FCFF
Please note: the beginning is the same as direct method for FCFE, just add points 4,5 and 6
Also: Change in IBD here has the opposite sign than before
 
STEP 3
FCFF Valuation
Once you calculated WACC (see the next section), or it is provided to you, you can do the FCFF Valuation.
Under WACC (for each year) calculate the WACC denominator
 
You need a WACC denominator if the WACC changes from a year to another.

 
 
 
WACC VALUATION

WACC = wd * rd * (1-t) + we * re
WACC = D/(D+E) * rd * (1-t) + E/(D+E) * re
Please note: take as E the market value of equity (share price * number of shares), not the equity from the balance sheet.
Rd = ??
Re = ??
 

 

 
Rf is calculated taking ytm of 10 year bond for the country (take it from ft.com)

Listed companies
o	Rd → you look at how much they pay on their bonds
o	Re → CAPM
Re = rf + beta * (Rm-Rf)
Re = rf + beta * MRP

-	Beta from ft.com
-	Risk free rate -> from ft.com ytm bond 10 years for the country
-	Mrp → Damodaran (total equity risk premium)
-	Cost of equity (use CAPM)
-	Capitalisation (share price*number of shares, or just take market cap from ft.com)
-	IBD → take short term and long term debt from b/s of company
-	Cost of debt can be calculated as interest cost on debt / (average debt this-last year)
-	Marginal tax rate
 
Thinly listed and Non-listed
-	Usa Damodaran
-	Take sector beta from Damodaran
-	relever
